# Visualizing-and-forecasting-stocks

### ✅ Objective
Using Dash, a Python framework, and a few machine learning models, create a single-page web application that displays firm information (logo, registered name, and description) and stock graphs based on the stock code entered by the user. Additionally, the ML model will give the user access to anticipated stock values for the date they enter.

### ✅ Project Context

One of the best returns on the market may be found with stock investing. Although they are volatile in nature, share prices and other statistical indicators may be visualised, which aids savvy investors in carefully selecting the firm they wish to put their profits in.Using the tabular data supplied by the Python module, we can create dynamic charts of the financial data of a particular firm by developing this straightforward project concept. Additionally, a machine learning system may be used to forecast future stock values.

### ✅ Model Architecture

The major objective of this project is to accurately forecast the closing price of the stock over an extended period of time in the future. In this project, the framework of the website was created using dash html components and dash core components, and the site's user interface was improved using CSS style. Data plots are produced using the Python plotly package, and the data is retrieved using yfinance. In order to forecast the stock price for the dates the user has specified, machine learning algorithms have been applied.

### ✅ Description 

Using plotly and dash, visualise and forecast stock prices. This project uses SVM to forecast the stock process for the amount of days specified in the input and generates charts depending on the ticker given (Suppot Vector Machines).

### ✅ Dependencies 

- Plotly
- Dash
- Bootstrap
- pip

### ✅ Project Outcome

In the world of the stock market, the potential for stock visualisation and forecasting is enormous. A method of visualising and predicting stocks is necessary to help investors make wise stock investments since, according to a recent research, the number of people trading in the stock market is rising every year. Because of how many variables it depends on, visualising stocks is a dangerous trend that frequently results in incorrect value estimates. With the assistance of a subject matter expert, this project may be expanded and improved in the future by training the model on new characteristics and adding some significant nonnumerical features as well.
