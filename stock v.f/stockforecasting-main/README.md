# Stock Visualizer and Forecasting
### ✅ Objective
Using Dash, a Python framework, and a few machine learning models, create a single-page web application that displays firm information (logo, registered name, and description) and stock graphs based on the stock code entered by the user. Additionally, the ML model will give the user access to anticipated stock values for the date they enter.

### ✅ Project Context

One of the best returns on the market may be found with stock investing. Although they are volatile in nature, share prices and other statistical indicators may be visualised, which aids savvy investors in carefully selecting the firm they wish to put their profits in.Using the tabular data supplied by the Python module, we can create dynamic charts of the financial data of a particular firm by developing this straightforward project concept. Additionally, a machine learning system may be used to forecast future stock values.

### ✅ Description
